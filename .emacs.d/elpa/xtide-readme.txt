;;; Commentary:

;; `M-x xtide' displays a tide height graph in Emacs using the "tide"
;; program from XTide (http://www.flaterco.com/xtide).
;;
;; `M-x calendar' is extended with a "T" key to display the tides for the
;; selected day (like "S" does for sunrise/sunset).
;;
;; The graph is a PNG image if your display supports that, otherwise XTide's
;; ascii-art fallback.  Left and right arrow keys move forward or back in
;; time.  The various alternative displays from xtide like "p" plain times
;; can be viewed too, see the mode help "C-h m" or the menu for the
;; possibilities.
;;
;; The location is taken from a customizable `xtide-location' variable, or
;; if that's not set then from the XTIDE_DEFAULT_LOCATION environment
;; variable which xtide uses.  If neither is set then M-x xtide starts in
;; the `xtide-location-mode' selector.  The "l" key goes there too, to go to
;; at a different place.  In the selector if you find a place close to what
;; you want then try "d" (`xtide-location-sort-distance') to sort by
;; distance from there.  If you've set `calendar-latitude' and
;; `calendar-longitude' for your location then try "C-u d" to sort by
;; distance from there.
